# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
-- Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is greater than $4500.
Sample table: CUSTOMERS
ID          NAME        AGE         ADDRESS     SALARY
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
1          Ramesh     32              Ahmedabad     2000
2          Khilan        25              Delhi                 1500
3          Kaushik      23              Kota                  2000
4          Chaitali       25             Mumbai            6500
5          Hardik        27              Bhopal              8500
6          Komal         22              Hyderabad       4500

7           Muffy          24              Indore            10000

```sql
--
select ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY
from CUSTOMERS
where salary>4500;
```

**Question 2**
---
-- From the following tables, write a SQL query to find all orders generated by the salespeople who may work for customers whose id is 3007. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.
Table Name: orders
